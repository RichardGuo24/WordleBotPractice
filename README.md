<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Wordle at its core is a simple game. But when you come across a word like PARER... its not the most fun experience. To combat this, I decided to solve wordle in a systematic way while also giving individuals a space for high pressure practice.

Introducing my own Wordle practice bot! You can test it below here.

### Built With

This section should list any major frameworks/libraries used to bootstrap your project. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

Use this space to show useful examples of how a project can be used. Additional screenshots, code examples and demos work well in this space. You may also link to more resources.

_For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://example.com)_

<h2 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h2>

The solver always chooses the guess that minimizes the expected number of answers left.  

1. **Start with all candidates.** At the beginning, every word in the solution pool is possible.  
2. **Simulate each guess.** For every candidate word, pretend it is the secret answer and compute the feedback (🟩/🟨/⬜) it would produce against all other words.  
3. **Group by feedback pattern.** Words that yield the same feedback form a “bucket” (e.g., 🟩⬜🟨⬜⬜).  
4. **Calculate expectation.** For each bucket, multiply its size by its probability (bucket size ÷ total). Adding these gives the *expected remaining pool size* if that word were guessed.  
5. **Pick the best guess.** Choose the word with the lowest expectation.  
6. **Repeat until solved.** Continue updating the pool and repeating the process until only one candidate remains, or until it is efficient to guess directly.  

This approach is similar to *20 Questions*: each guess partitions the space of answers, and the best guess is the one that splits the space most evenly.


<h2 id="contributing">Contributing</h2>

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

If you have a suggestion that would make this better, please fork the repo and create a pull request. You can also simply open an issue with the tag "enhancement".

<h2 id="acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</h2>

Shout out to the friends at Jane Street that helped me get started on this project over a year ago. Came back to improve on the algorithm and also put it on a fullstack application.
